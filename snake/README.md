If Nokia can bring back the 3310 we can bring back snake.

How To Play
-----------

Move your dot around and the screen to collect the faded lights. The more lights you collect the
longer your snake gets. Hit the edge of the board, or the your own tail and it's Game Over!

Button `A` turns you left, `B` turns your right, but remember, it's relative to the direction you're
travelling. If you're heading down left is right and right is left.
