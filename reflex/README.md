Reflex

How quick are your reflexes? Pretty fast? Test them out on this.

How To Play
-----------

The board is divided into 2 sides. At some point within 3 seconds a light will appear on one of the sides. Click the button on that side before the light fades out to get the points. The brighter the light, the more the points but be warned, click the wrong button and we start taking away points.

There are three rounds of 5 lights and each round the fade gets faster. Can you still get the maximum points?
