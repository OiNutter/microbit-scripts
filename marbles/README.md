Marbles
=======

A simple game based on the old rolling marble puzzles.

How To Play
-----------

On the board you've got 1 bright light, that's you, and four dimmer lights, they're your targets. Tilt the microbit back and forth to move the light around and get it onto one of the dimmer lights. Keep it there for 2 seconds to clear the light.

How fast can you clear the board?
